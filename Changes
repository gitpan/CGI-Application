Revision history for Perl extension CGI::Application.

4.07_02 Weds Oct 31, 2007

    [DOCUMENTATION]
    - typo corrections (Evan Zacks)
    - The docs for header_type() have been improved, including an example of using
      CGI::Applicatin::Plugin::Redirect (Mark Stosberg)

    [INTERNALS] 
    - Reverted switch to Class::MOP in 4.07_01, which benchmarking showed
      to be slower. (Mark Stosberg)
    - Beautify the code for _send_headers (Chris Dolan, Mark Stosberg)

4.07_01 Sun Jul 2, 2006

    [INTERNALS] 
    - Switched from using Class::ISA to Class::MOP for introspection. Class::MOP
      models the way this will be done Perl6, providing the same result. (Mark Stosberg) 
    - better test diagnostics (rjbs)
    - improve test coverage (rjbs)
    - improve consistency of checks for false/0len/undef (rjbs)
    - split &run up into chunks (not yet finalized). New methods currently include:
        __get_runmode
        __get_runmeth
        __get_body
      Feedback is welcome on whether these should be exposed to the user, with
      (possibly) better names. (rjbs)

4.06 Wed Apr 12, 2006
    (No code changes)
    - Updated tests to work with status codes emitted before and after CGI.pm 3.16. 
      The requirement for CGI.pm 3.16 or newer has been relaxed, so any version
      of CGI.pm will do. (Rhesa)

4.05 Wed Mar  1, 2006
    (No code changes)

    -  Updated tests for redirects to check for 'Found', not 'Moved'.
       This correctly matches the standard, and was changed in CGI.pm 3.16.
       As a result, we now require CGI.pm 3.16 for consistent results.

4.04    Wed Oct 11, 2005
    - No code changes since 4.04_02. Declaring stable. 

4.04_02 Thu Sep 8, 2005 
    - Add support for templates stored in file handles and scalarrefs to load_tmpl(). 
      (Jason Purdy)  

4.04_01 Wed Aug 31, 2005
    -  move load_tmpl hook to after we build $tmpl_file so it will always have a
      (probably) valid file to work with.

    - initial support for a default template name in load_tmpl(). That means
      you can now do this:

      my $t = $self->load_tmpl();

      And it will default to a file named after the current run mode with a
      .html extension. 

4.03  Thu Aug 04, 2005
    - Fixed important bug introduced in 4.02 in which a mode_param
      set in a sub-class would have been ignored. A new automated test
      was added to prevent this regression in the future. 

4.02  Sat Jul 30, 2005

    - Documented existence of CGI::Application::Plugin::FillInForm.

    - path_info option to mode_param now supports negative index numbers
      to grab the run mode name from the other end of the PATH_INFO. 
      (Thilo Planz)

    - Altered how "start_mode" default is set, allowing it to be set
      through the hook system in the 'init' phase. Existing applications
      should be unaffected.

    - Return value of run_modes() was documented.

    - Integrate more examples of using plugins into the documentation.

    - 'error' hook was added, which is executed just before error_mode() might
      be called. An example use of this would be a logging plugin that wants to
      log that the application died. Although it's unlikely to change, it is marked
      as experimental for now.

4.01 Tue Jun 14, 2005

    NOTE: This release has an important incompatibility from the 4.0 release
    two days ago. The 'load_tmpl' hook which was just introduced has had it's
    interface changed. The change allows plug-in authors to affect the parameters
    passed to the 'new' constructor of the template object, instead of just adding
    parameters later. 

4.0 Fri Jun 10, 2005
    This release adds a major new feature of special interest to plugin
    authors: 'hooks'. This concept helps to create plugins that are more powerful
    and simpler to use for end users. See the documentation on writing plugins for
    details.

    Special thanks to Cees Hek and Michael Graham for their effort to develop
    and refine the hook system.

    Since the last major release, there has been an explosion of new plugins
    developed. This is an incomplete list of modules below the
    'CGI::Application::Plugin' namespace. Expect more to be added and updated soon
    with the advent of the hook system: 

      ::AnyTemplate - Use any templating system with a unified interface 
      ::Apache - Use Apache::* modules without interference
      ::AutoRunmode - Automatically register runmodes
      ::ConfigAuto - Integration with Config::Auto
      ::Config::Context - Integration with Config::Context
      ::Config::General - Integration with Config::General
      ::Config::Simple - Integration with Config::Simple
      ::CompressGzip - Add Gzip compression 
      ::DBH - Integration with DBI
      ::LogDispatch - Integration with Log::Dispatch
      ::Session - Integration with CGI::Session
      ::Stream - Help stream files to the browser
      ::TT - Use Template::Toolkit as an alternative to HTML::Template
      ::ValidateRM - Integration with Data::FormValidator and HTML::FillInForm

    The following additional changes are also present in this release:

    - Enhanced tests and documentation for error_mode(). (Rob Kinyon). 
    - Clarified Plug-in documentation (Timothy Appnel)
    - Avoid some warnings when getting run mode from PATH_INFO (Emanuele Zeppieri)
    - Use query() object to get PATH_INFO, to workaround bug in IIS web server. (Mark Stosberg)
    - Documented return value of header_props()

3.31 Sun Sep 26, 2004
    - Documentation clean-ups. No code changes. 

3.30  Sun Sep 26, 2004
    - Refactored test suite to use Test::More (Gabor Szabo)
    - Removed warnings being emitted for documented API calls
    - minor code clean-up to load_tmpl() (Emanuele Zeppieri)
	- Support for passing multiple template paths to HTML::Template (Michael Peters) 
	- Added error_mode to support trapping runmodes dying (Rob Kinyon)
	- Added Plug-in related documentation. (Mark Stosberg) 
	- mode_param() updated to more easily set the run mode from $ENV{PATH_INFO} (Mark Stosberg)

3.22  Fri Feb 13, 2004
    - The nocgicarp flag introduced in 3.2 has now been removed due
      to ill importing side effects. Instead, we now simply use Carp
      instead of CGI::Carp. You must now explicitly load CGI::Carp if you want
      it. Any code that used the brief-lived 'nocgicarp' feature will need to
      be updated. 
    - Support for run modes named '0'. (Josh Glover)

3.21  Wed Feb 4, 2004
    - Updated some header tests to be compatible with old and new versions of CGI.pm, which
      handled the capitalization of the header differently. (Mark Stosberg) 

3.2   Sat Jan 31, 2004
    - header_add() has been added to allow setting extra headers, particularly cookies,
      after header_props has already been called (Cees Hek, Mark Stosberg)
    - CGI::Carp is now optional. See docs for details. (Steve Hay)
    - Avoid 'unitialized value' warning on redirects (Cees Hek)
    - Some tests added (Mark Stosberg)
    - Updated documentation to use term "Run Mode" consistently, versus "Run-Mode" with
      a dash. Run-mode-with-a-dash is dead. Don't revive it. Also added mentions
      of the CGI::Application wiki and CGI::Application::ValidateRM
      (Mark Stosberg)
    - Fixed typo in cgiapp_postrun documentation (Steve Hay)
    - Improved exception handling (Steve Hay)
    - delete() method added to remove items stored using param() (Michael Peters)
    - 'CGI_APP_RETURN_ONLY' environment variable that is used for testing is now 
	documented (Michael Peters)
    - dump_html() is now properly HTML-escaped (podmaster, Brian Cassidy)
    - Migrated from Makefile.PL to Build.PL. Either can now be used for installation.
    - Updated 'Changes' file to put new releases on top.

3.1   Mon Jun  2 07:54:31 EDT 2003
    - Changed dump_html default run mode to be referenced by name 
      instead of sub-ref.  This allows dump_html() to be overridden 
      in sub-class.
	- Added current run mode to output of dump() and dump_html().
	  (Thanks to Mark Stosberg for the suggestion.)
	- Added example of doing an HTTP redirect (suggested by Sam Tregar)
	- Fixed bug where non-CGI.pm query objects couldn't be set
	  at initialization time via the new() method.  (Thanks to Steve 
	  Hay for the catch.)
    - Added header_type("none") to surpress HTTP header output.
      (Thanks to Steve Comrie for the suggestion.)
    - Numerous typos corrected in POD.
    - Added cgiapp_postrun() hook.  This hook allows run mode output
      to be "pipelined" through optional filters, modifying the
      content and HTTP headers if so desired.

3.0   Sat Feb  1 02:27:19 EST 2003
	- Changed run_modes() method to allow list of run modes to be 
	  designated via an array reference.  This will automatically
	  create a run modes table which maps from a run mode to a 
	  run mode method of the same name.  Bumped major revision
	  number to reflect this significant change in functionality.
	- Clarified license for module (GPL or Artistic).  Included
	  licenses in distribution package.

2.6   Mon Oct  7 07:34:35 EDT 2002
	- Changed the run() method to use Perl's built-in dynamic method
	  call for all run modes, whether by name or by code ref.  This
	  is intended to improve run-time performance somewhat.  Thanks 
	  to Darin McBride for this patch.
	- Added new override-able method cgiapp_get_query().  This method
	  is called when CGI::Application first needs access to the CGI
	  query object.  By default, this is a CGI.pm object.  It is 
	  possible to override the cgiapp_get_query() method to return 
	  an object of some other module besides CGI.pm, providing
	  that it is sufficiently compatible.  Thanks to Eric Andreychek
	  for the suggestion and his help troubleshooting the code.

2.5   Thu Jul 18 07:45:47 EDT 2002
	- Changed mailing list address.  The new mailing list address.
	  To subscribe: cgiapp-subscribe@lists.erlbaum.net
	  To post message: cgiapp@lists.erlbaum.net

2.4   Sat May 25 13:32:44 EDT 2002
	- Modified tmpl_path() to propagate to HTML::Template's PATH
	  parameter.  This provides much more useful and intuitive 
	  behavior.  Thanks to Sam Tregar for the patch!
	- Added prerun_mode() method to allow the run mode to be
	  dynamically changed inside the cgiapp_prerun() method.  
	  Thanks to Steve Comrie for the suggestion of using a 
	  method call for this function.  Thanks to many other list 
	  members for further refining this idea.
	- Refactored some test cases, general code clean-up.
	- Refactored POD a bit to make it less intimidating for
	  new users.

2.3   Mon May  6 07:12:09 EDT 2002
	- Fixed minor bug in build system for older Perl versions.

2.2   Sun Aug 19 12:20:21 EDT 2001
	- Added new module CGI::Application::Mailform as both an 
	  example of how to use CGI::Application and a useful
	  (albeit simple) reusable web-based application.
	- CGI::Application::Mailform allows the contents of 
	  data submitted through HTML forms to be easily sent
	  via email to a specified recipient.  This application 
	  is intended to be very easy to reuse, yet secure
	  and functional enough to replace some of the most
	  onerous "mailform" scripts which have been floating
	  around the Internet for ages. 
	- Added cgiapp_prerun() hook, for adding global behaviors 
	  before the run mode method is called.  The cgiapp_prerun()
	  gets the name of the run mode as a parameter.  This would
	  allow the user to perform some action based on the
	  current run mode.

2.1   Sat Aug 11 12:57:49 EDT 2001
	- The param() method has been extended to allow multiple parameters
	  to be set at one time, via a hash (or hashref).
	- Fixed bug in run() method where a null-string run mode would be
	  considered valid.  A zero-length run mode will now result in the 
	  start_mode() being called.
	  (Thanks to Mark Stosberg for the two preceding ideas!)
	- The run_mode() method now may be called a subsequent time to 
	  amend the list of run modes.

2.0   Sun Jun 24 23:01:58 EDT 2001
	- Added ability to set mode_param() to use a call-back instance method
	  (specified by subref) instead of a CGI parameter.
	- HTML::Template is now only loaded if load_tmpl() is called.
	  (Thanks to Stephen Howard for the two preceding ideas!)
	- Run modes may now return scalar-refs in addition to scalars.
	- Added new run mode of last resort: "AUTOLOAD".  See POD for usage.
	- Updated MAJOR REVISION number to 2 -- new functionality deserves it.

1.31  Mon May 28 14:06:16 EDT 2001
	- Updated docs to favor new name-based run mode method references.

1.3   Sun May 20 18:48:36 EDT 2001
	- Enhanced capabilities for creating general superclasses for your projects.
	- All run modes may be referenced by method name, in addition to subref.
	- Created cgiapp_init() hook to allow for inherited common behaviors.
	- Fixed minor bugs in default values.

1.2   Fri Jul 14 01:49:30 EDT 2000
	- Modified load_tmpl() to pass extra params to HTML::Template->new_file().
	- Fixed up the docs a bit.
	- Minor code clean-up.

1.1   Tue Jul 11 22:59:17 EDT 2000
	- Tweaked test.pl to avoid CGI.pm command line debugging interface 
          which requires user to hit CTRL-D to continue
	- Added ANNOUNCE file.

1.0   Mon Jul  10 23:47:30 2000
	- Release 1.0 complete.  Woohoo!

0.01  Mon Jul  3 20:40:30 2000
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.19
