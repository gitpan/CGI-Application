	- Release 1.0 complete.  Woohoo!

1.1   Tue Jul 11 22:59:17 EDT 2000
	- Tweaked test.pl to avoid CGI.pm command line debugging interface 
          which requires user to hit CTRL-D to continue
	- Added ANNOUNCE file.

1.2   Fri Jul 14 01:49:30 EDT 2000
	- Modified load_tmpl() to pass extra params to HTML::Template->new_file().

	- Minor code clean-up.

1.3   Sun May 20 18:48:36 EDT 2001
	- Enhanced capabilities for creating general superclasses for your projects.
	- All run modes may be referenced by method name, in addition to subref.
	- Created cgiapp_init() hook to allow for inherited common behaviors.
	- Fixed minor bugs in default values.

1.31  Mon May 28 14:06:16 EDT 2001
	- Updated docs to favor new name-based run-mode method references.

2.0   Sun Jun 24 23:01:58 EDT 2001
	- Added ability to set mode_param() to use a call-back instance method
	  (specified by subref) instead of a CGI parameter.
	- HTML::Template is now only loaded if load_tmpl() is called.
	  (Thanks to Stephen Howard for the two preceding ideas!)
	- Run-modes may now return scalar-refs in addition to scalars.
	- Added new run-mode of last resort: "AUTOLOAD".  See POD for usage.
	- Updated MAJOR REVISION number to 2 -- new functionality deserves it.
