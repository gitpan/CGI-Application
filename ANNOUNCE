CHANGES SINCE VERSION 1.31:
- Added ability to set mode_param() to use a call-back instance method
  (specified by subref) instead of a CGI parameter.
- HTML::Template is now only loaded if load_tmpl() is called.
  (Thanks to Stephen Howard for the two preceding ideas!) 
- Run-modes may now return scalar-refs in addition to scalars.
- Added new run-mode of last resort: "AUTOLOAD".  See POD for usage.
- Updated MAJOR REVISION number to 2 -- new functionality deserves it.


Read the recent "Using CGI::Application" article on Perl.com for an 
overview of the module and its usage:

  http://www.perl.com/pub/2001/06/05/cgi.html


CGI::Application is intended to make it easier to create sophisticated,
reusable web-based applications. This module implements a methodology which,
if followed, will make your web software easier to design, easier to
document, easier to write, and easier to evolve.

CGI::Application builds on standard, non-proprietary technologies and 
techniques, such as the Common Gateway Interface and Lincoln D. Stein's 
excellent CGI.pm module.  CGI::Application judiciously avoids employing 
technologies and techniques which would bind a developer to any one set 
of tools, operating system or web server.

The guiding philosophy behind CGI::Application is that a web-based
application can be organized into a specific set of "Run-Modes." Each
Run-Mode is roughly analogous to a single screen (a form, some output, etc).
All the Run-Modes are managed by a single "Application Module" which is a
Perl module. In your web server's document space there is an "Instance
Script" which is called by the web server as a CGI (or an Apache::Registry
script if you're using Apache + mod_perl).

CGI::Application is an Object-Oriented Perl module which implements an
Abstract Class. It is not intended that this package be instantiated
directly. Instead, it is intended that your Application Module will be
implemented as a Sub-Class of CGI::Application.
